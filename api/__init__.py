"""FastAPI transport layer around the RAG ChatSession.

This package is a thin HTTP wrapper: all retrieval / generation / state
behavior lives in ``src/`` (most importantly ``src.session.ChatSession``).
See AGENTS.md (and src/AGENTS.md) — duplicating ChatSession invariants in
another caller is how they drift, so the API only marshals requests in and
events out.
