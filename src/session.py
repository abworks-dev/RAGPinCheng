"""Multi-turn RAG session orchestration.

Owns the per-turn pipeline:
    ① rewrite  ② retrieve  ③ merge  ④ generate  ⑤ update state

Channel separation is enforced here:
  - Conversation channel: `SessionState.messages` (text only; <sources> stripped)
  - Knowledge channel: `SessionState.last_sources` (typed RetrievedParent objects)
The two never mix inside the message list sent to the LLM.

Two entry points share the pipeline:
  - `ask()` — synchronous, returns a fully resolved TurnResult. Used by the
    eval CLI and any programmatic caller that wants the complete answer.
  - `ask_stream()` — returns (prep, generator). Consume the generator to drive
    token-by-token UI rendering; state is finalized when the generator
    exhausts, and `self.last_turn_result` then holds the full TurnResult.
