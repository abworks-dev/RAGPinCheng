"""Typed records used by the eval harness.

`EvalItem` is the on-disk schema for both `drafts.jsonl` (pre-review) and
`golden.jsonl` (curated). One line of JSONL = one EvalItem.

Grading is `parent_id` set-based (A:1 choice): a retrieval is "correct" iff
at least one of the parent_ids returned by the system is in
`expected_parent_ids`. `source_parent_id` is the parent the synthesizer
derived the question from — kept around so reviewers can broaden the gold
set during curation if the question turns out answerable from multiple
parents.
